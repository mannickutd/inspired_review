## Chapter 30 Product Objectives @ Scale

- At scale colleagues cannot possibly understand what every other team is trying to achieve. Product teams need help with understanding what they should be focusing on.
- Product teams can often have other product teams that help fulfill a service to another product team. Eg. Platform product teams.
- OKR's need to go through several iterations that leadership and management can identify gaps and revise with teams to make sure gaps are filled.
- Tools are important to help everyone align and track progress of all teams.
- The larger the organisation the more important delivery teams become. Managing dependencies and commitments cannot be left to individual product teams.
- When using OKRs at scale, there's a larger burden on leadership and management to ensure that the organisation is truly aligned, that each and every product team understands how they fit into the mix, and that they ar there to contribute.
