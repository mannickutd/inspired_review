## Chapter 58 Discovery Sprint Technique

* A discovery sprint is a one-week time box of product discovery work, designed to tackle a substantial problem or risk your product team is facing.
* There is several books describing the technique, lay out a 5 day week that starts with framing the problem by mapping the problem space, picking the problem to be solved and the target customer, and then progresses into pursuing down and fleshes out the different potential solutions, then creates a high fidelity user prototype -- finally, putting that prototype in front of actual target users and observing their reactions.
