## Chapter 50 Testing Usability

* User testing is typically the most mature and straightforward form of discovery testing.
* Usually done with a high fidelity user prototype.
* Good to have product manager, product designer and one of the engineers present.
* Be prepared with a set of tasks that you want the user to complete (attempt).
* You want to learn whether the user or customer really has the problems we thing they have, and how they solve those problems today, and what it would take for them to switch.
* Keep the user focused on trying to use the product instead of trying to critique what is in front of them.
* The main skill for the person implementing the test is keeping quiet.
* Avoid leading the 'witness' in any way.
* Act like a parrot, repeat what they say to you trying to prompt further explanation of what they meant.
* Fundamentally you're trying to get an understanding of how your target users think about this problem and to identify places in your prototype where the model the software presents is inconsistent or incompatible with how the user is thinking about the problem.
* The point is to gain a deeper understanding of your users and customers and, of course, to identify the friction points in the prototype so you can fix them.
