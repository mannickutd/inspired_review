## Chapter 51 Testing Value

* Common mistake of product teams is that by reaching feature parity they will be able to convert users to use their product.
* The customer must percieve your product to be substantially better to motivate them to buy your product and then wade through the pain and obstacles of migrating from their old solution.
* You need to test demand for your product or feature.
* Qualitative value testing, focus on the customers response, do customers love this, will they pay for it, will users choose to use it and if not why not?
* Quantitattively value testing, test efficacy, refers to how well this solution solves the underlying problem. In some types of products this is very objective and quantitative.
