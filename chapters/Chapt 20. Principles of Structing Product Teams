## Chapter 20 Principles of Structuring Product Teams

- One of the most difficult issues facing every product organization at scale is just how to split up your product across your many product teams.
- Its also a significant factor in keeping teams feeling empowered and accountable for something meaningful, yet contributing to a bigger vision where the sum is greater than the parts.
1. Alignment with investment strategy
  Bad strategy is where the teams are reflections of their ongoing investments. Teams exist because they always have. The investment strategy should be reflected in the product teams.
2. Minimize dependencies
  Minimize dependencies both in technology and products. This helps teams move faster and feel more autonomous.
3. Ownership and automony
  One of the most important traits of product teams is we want a team of missionaries and not teams of mercenaries.
4. Maximise leverage
  There is a balance between sharing services and having autonomy and minimising dependencies.
5. Product vision and strategy
  The product vision describes where we as an organization are trying to go, and the product strategy describes the major milestones to get there.
6. Team size
  Minimum 2 engineers and a PM, maximum enough to be feed by 2 pizzas.
7. Alignment with architecture
  Start with the product vision, come up with an architectureal approach to delivery that vision, and then design the teams around that architecture.
8. Alignment with user or customer
  Aligning with the user and customer has very real benefits for the product and for the team. There will be teams that focus on products and users, other teams will focus on shared services.
9. Alignment with business
  Our business unit structure is an artifical construct. The different business units are often selling to teh same actual customers.
10. Structure is a moving target
  Realize that the optimal structure of the product organization is a moving target. Revising your team structure every year or so makes sense.
  
- "I attribute most of the benefits to the increased level of motivation and true sense of ownership when teams feel more in control of their own destiny."
