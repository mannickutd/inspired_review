## Chapter 36 Customer Letter Technique
- Typical product team problems, an opportunity assessment is usually sufficient.
- Amazon press release technique
- Working backward process, where you start the effort with a pretend press release.
- The idea is that the product manager frames the work ahead of the team by writing an imagined press release of what it would be like once this product launches. How does it improve the life of our customers? What are the real benefits to them? this is an imagined narrative describing the future state we want to create.
- Focus on the benefits that it will bring to the customer and the disruption it will make rather than just a listing of product features.
- Customer letter technique
- The idea is that rather than communicate the benefits in a press release format, you describe them in the format of a customer letter written from the hypothetical perspective of one of your product's well defined user or customer personas. The letter sent to the CEO from a very happy and impressed customer - explains why he or she is so happy and grateful for the new product or redesign. The customer describes how it has changed or improved his or her life. The letter also includes an imagined congratulatory response from the CEO to the product team explaining how this has helped the business.
