## Chapter 24 Product Vision and Product Strategy

- The product vision describes the future we are trying to create, typically somewhere between two and five years out. Its primary purpose is to communicate this vision and inspire the teams to want to help make this vision a reality.
- Trying to please everybody at once will almost certainly please nobody.
- The product strategy is our sequence of products or releases we plan to deliver on the path to realizing the product vision.
- Theres no single approach to product strategy that is ideal for everyone, and you can never know how things might have gone if you sequenced your product work differently. I tell teams that the most important benefit is just that you decided to focus your product work on a single target market at a time.
- The difference between vision and strategy is analogous to the difference between good leadership and good management. Leadership inspires and sets the direction, and management helps get us there.
- Product vision should be inspiring and the product strategy should be focused.
- Prioritizing market
  1. Market sizing, 'total addressable market' TAM. 
  2. Distribution, 'go to market' GTM.
  3. Estimation, 'time to market' TTM.
- All of these need to be taken into account (balanced) when prioritizing which market to focus on.
