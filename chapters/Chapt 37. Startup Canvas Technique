## Chapter 37 Startup Canvas Technique

- Early stage startup where you're creating a new product, or a new business opportunity for larger companies.
- You're not being asked to improve an existing product, you're being asked to invent an entirely new product.
- One of the things I like about a startup canvas is that it helps to quickly highlight the key assumptions and major risks facing a startup or a significant new product in an existing business.
- The major risk facing most efforts is 'value' risk. On the startup canvas this shows up as solution risk. A solution that your customres will choose to buy and use.
- To overcome 'value' risk, in an established market it must be demonstrably and substantially better.
- 'market' risk is probably up for its fair share of failed products. A new product that solves a problem that the customers don't care enough about.
