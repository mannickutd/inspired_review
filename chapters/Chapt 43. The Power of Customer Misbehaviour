## Chapter 43 The Power of Customer Misbehaviour

- Historically two main approaches used by good teams to come up with product opportunities have been:
  1. Try to assess the market opportunities and pick potentially lucrative areas where significant pain exists.
  2. Look at what the technology or data enables - whats just now possible - and match that up with the significant pain.
- There is a third approach, is to encourage our customers to use our products to solve problems other than what we planned for and offically support.
- I consider developers to be one of the consistently best sources of truly innovative product ideas.
