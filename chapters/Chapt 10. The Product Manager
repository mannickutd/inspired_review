## Chapter 10 The Product Manager

* The Product Manager is not a glorified Product Owner, they are not a backlog administrator, they are not there to leave decisions to the CEO.
* The Product Manager needs to manage stake holders and does not want 'develop by committee'.
* "The honest truth, the product manager needs to be one of the strongest talents of the company."
* "Every business depends on customers. And what customers buy - or choose to use - is your product. The product is the result of what the product team builds, and the product manager is responsible for what the product team will build."
* Deep knowledge of the customer - issues, pains, desires and how they think/behave.
* Deep knowledge of the data - qualitative and quantative analytical skills are needed.
* Deep knowledge of the business - "Successful products are not only loved by your customers, but they work for your business." Product Managers have to understand how the product fits within the business.
* Deep knowledge of your market and industry - knowledge of the market/industry, key trends in technology, customer behaviours and expectations.
* "The successful product manager must be the very best versions of smart, creative and persistent."
* "Become your team's and your company's go to person for understanding anything about your customer - quantitative and qualitative."
* "Work to establish a strong relationship with your key stakeholders and business partners."
* "Become an undisputed expert on your product and your industry. Again share your knowledge openly and generously."
* "Finally work very hard to build and nurture the strong collaborative relationship with your product team."
* "Product Management is absolutely distinct from the other disciplines."
* "Like a CEO, the product manager must deeply understand all aspects of the business."
* "In every one of these examples, the winning solutions didn't come from users, customers, or sales."
* "True leadership is a big part of what separates the great product people from the merely good ones."
