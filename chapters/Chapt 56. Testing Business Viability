## Chapter 56 Testing Business Viability

* The solution must work for the business.
* The business model must be viable.
* The costs to produce, market and sell the product must be sufficiently less than the revenue your product generates.
* You must operate within the laws of the countries you sell in.
* You must hold up your end of business agreements and partnerships.
* Your product must fit within the brand promise of your company's other otherings.
* You need to help protect your company's revenue, reputation, employees, and customers you've worked so hard to earn.
* There are three very different techniques for showing the prototype, and you have to be careful to use the right technique for the right situation.
  1. Walkthrough, is when you show your prototype to a stakeholder and you want to make sure they see and not absolutely everything that might be a concern. Give the stakeholder a chance to spot any potential areas of concern or problems. Usually the product manager drives.
  2. User test, is when we test our product ideas on real users and customers. The user is driving the product.
  3. A product demo, is when you sell your product to prospective users and customers, or evangelize your product across your company. This is a sales or persuasive tool.
