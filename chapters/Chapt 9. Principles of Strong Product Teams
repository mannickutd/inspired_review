## Chapter 9. Principles of Strong Product Teams

* "A product team is a group of people who bring together different specialized skills and responsibilities and feel real ownership for a product or at least a substantial piece of a larger product.
* "We need teams of missionaries, not teams of mercenaries".
* Team Composition - A typical product team is comprised of a product manager, a product designer, and 2 - 12 engineers. Could vary depending on the type of product. Possibly UX designer, data anaylst, machine learning engineer.
* Team Empowerment and Accountability - There to solve hard problems, given clear objectives and they own delivering on those objectives and accountable for the results.
* Team Size - 2 pizza rule, absolute size of the team is the balance of the skills needed.
* Team Reporting Structure - Every member is an individual contributor to the product team. Each member will report to their respective position head. Eg. product designer will report to the head of design.
* Team Collaboration - Its about product, design, engineering coming together for long periods.
* Team Location - If at all possible team should be co-located to promote collaboration. Prefer actual employees instead of contractors or agencies.
* Team Scope - The team should have responsibility of all the work, the projects, features, bug fixes, performance work, optimizations, and content changes - everything and anything for the product. Easier for smaller companies becomes harder the size and no. of product teams in the company. No perfect way to carve up the pie.
* Team Duration - Stability, longevity, expertise and experience builds over time.
* Team Autonomy - Innovation and "missionary-like passion for solving customers problem" comes from autonomy. "They are able to try to solve the problems they are assigned in the best way they see fit".
* Why it works - "First, collaboration is built on relationships, and product teams - especially those co-located teams - are designed to nurture these relationships. Second to innovate you need expertise, and the durable nature of product teams lets people go deep enough to gain that expertise. Third, instead of just building what others determine might be valuable, in the product team model the full team understands - needs to understand - the business objectives and context. And most important, the full team feels ownership and responsibility for the outcome."
