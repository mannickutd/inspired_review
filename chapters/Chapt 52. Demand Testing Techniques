## Demand Testing Techniques

* One of the biggest wastes of time for many businesses is going through the entire product lifecycle and releasing something that just doesn't have the demand for. This is avoidable.
* Fake door demand test, the idea is to put the button or menu item into the user experience exactly where we believe it should be. When the user clicks on that button, rather than taking the user to the new feature, it instead takes the user to a special page that explains that you are studying the possibility of adding this new feature, and you're seeking users to volunteer.
* Similar technique uses the landing page for a new product.
* The most important point for technology companies; if you stop innovating you will die. That being said we need to do it in a responsible way.
* How to protect brand and revenue? live data prototypes, A/B testing frameworks, limit the testing to a small number of users possibly under NDA.
* How to protect employees and customers? Be preprared for tests, don't use deployments/engineers as tools where you're not prepared.
* There is a balance between innovation and testing ideas and protecting your brand, revenue, customers and employees.
