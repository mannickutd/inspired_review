## Chapter 62 Communicating Product Learnings

* Head of product (VP of product), at the company all-hands or similar meeting every week or two, to take 15 to 30 minutes to highlight what has been learned in product discovery across the various product teams.
* The big learnings are important to share broadly, especially when things don't go as hoped. As a side benefit, sometimes someone in the audience has an insight about what might explain the results.
* This is a useful and easy way for the various product teams to keep apprised of what other teams are learning, as well as ensuring that useful learnings make it to the leaders.
* This technique encourages the product teams to keep their focus on big learnings and not on minor experimentation that doesn't have a real customer or business impact one way or the other.
* Culturally, its critical that the organization understand that discovery and innovation is about continuously running these rapid experiments and learning from the results.
* It is also important culturally that the product organisation be transparent and generous in what they learn and how they work. It helps the broader organisation to understand that the product organisation is not there 'to serve the business' but, rather, to solve problems for our customers in ways that work for our business.
