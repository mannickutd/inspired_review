## Chapter 23 The Alternative to Roadmaps

- Reasons for roadmaps:
  1. The first purpose is because the management of the company wants to make sure that teams are working on the highest-business-value items first.
  2. The second purpose is because - since they're trying to run a business- there are cases where they need to make date-based commitments, and the roadmap is where they see and track those commitments (even those most companies, they rarely trust the dates anymore).
- For product teams to be able to fulfil their goals they need to understand the context for the problems they are trying to solve.
  1. The product vision and strategy.
  2. The business objectives.
- The idea behind business objectives is simple enough; tell the team what you need them to accomplish and how the results will be measured, and let the team figure out the best way to solve the problems.
- It is managements responsibility to provide each product team with the specific business objectives they need to tackle.
- Management should focus on prioritizing business results.
- Outcome based roadmaps - product teams are focusing on solving business problems rather than building features. Only put dates on problems that really need dates.
- Its a constant struggle between those executives and stakeholders who are trying to run a business and the product team that is understandably reluctant to commit to dates and deliverables.
