## Chapter 17 The Head of Product Role

- Competencies:
  1. Team development.
  2. Product vision.
  3. Execution.
  4. Product culture.
 
 # Team development
 - The single most important responsibility of any VP product is to develop a strong team of product managers. This means making recruiting, training, and ongoing coaching the top priority. Realize that developing great people requires a different set of skills than developing great products, which is why many otherwise excellent product managers and designers never progress to leading organisations.
 
 # Product Vision and Strategy
 - The product vision is what derives and inspires the company and sustains the company through the ups and downs.
 - The product leader should be an expert on modern forms of product planning, customer discovery, product discovery, and product development process but execution also means that they know how to work effectively as part of an organization of your size. The bigger the organization the more critical the skills in stakeholder management and internal evangelism.
 - Strong product culture means that the team understands the importance of continuous and rapid testing and learning. They understand that they need to make mistakes in order to learn, but they need to make them quickly and mitigate the risks. They understand the need for continuous innovation.
 - Really important that the CTO, CEO and CPO have a great chemistry to collaborate together.
 - GPM (Group Product Manager) part individual contributor and part first level people manager.
