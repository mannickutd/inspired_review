## Chapter 7 Beyond Lean and Agile

* Lean or Agile or Lean agile or silver bullet? There is no silver bullet.
* Three underlying principles with whatever name you put on the process:
  1. Risks are tackled up front, rather than at the end.
  2. Products are defined and designed collaboratively, rather than sequentially.
  3. Finally, it's all about solving problems, not implementing features.
