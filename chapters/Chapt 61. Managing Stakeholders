## Chapter 61 Managing Stakeholders

* Stakeholders usually include:
  1. The executive team (CEO and leaders and marketing, sales, and technology).
  2. Business partners (to make sure the product and the business are aligned).
  3. Finance (to make sure the product fits within the finanical parameters and model of the company).
  4. Legal (to make sure that what you propose is defensible).
  5. Compliance (to make sure what you propose complies with any relevant standards or policies).
  6. Business development (to make sure what you propose does not violate any existing contracts or relationships)
* The product manager responsibilities (for a stakeholder) is to understand the considerations and constraints of each stakeholder and to bring this knowledge into the product team.
* "Success in terms of stakeholder management means that your stakeholders respect you and your contribution. They trust that you understand their concerns and will ensure solutions work well for them too. They trust that you will keep them informed of important decisions or changes. ** They give you the room to come up with the test solutions possible."
* Success relationships are built on:
  1. One on one time with the key stakeholders.
  2. Listen to their concerns, ideas.
  3. Explain the better you understand their concerns the better the solution will be.
  4. Ask lots of questions.
  5. Be open and transparent.
* In discovery you're not only making sure that your solutions are valuable and usable (with customers), and feasible (with engineers), but you are also making sure your stakeholders will support the proposed solution.
