## Chapter 65 Top Reasons for Loss of Innovation

* Consistent innovation is the ability of a team to repeatedly add value to the business.
* Many organisations loss the ability to innovate at scale.
* The following attributes are associated with companies who innovate at scale:
  1. Customer-centric culture "Customers are always beautifully, wonderfully dissatisfied, even when they report being happy and business is great. Even when they don't yet know it, customers want something better, and your desire to delight customers will drive you to invent on their behalf."
  2. Compelling product vision, the vision changes over time and scope as a company grows. The product vision needs to stay as compelling as when the company first started.
  3. Focused product strategy, you cannot please everyone at once. The product strategy needs to spell out a logical and intentional sequence of target markets for the product teams to focus on.
  4. Strong product managers, the lack of a strong and capable product manager is typically a major reason for lack of product innovation.
  5. Stable product teams, one of the prerequisites for consistent innovation is a team that has had a chance to learn the space, technologies, and customer pain.
  6. Engineers in discovery, engineers need to be there from the beginning, exposing them directly to the customers pain.
  7. Corporate courage, companies tend to become risk adverse as they grow larger. The riskiest strategy of all is to stop taking risks.
  8. Empowered product teams, empowerment means the teams are able to tackle and solve the business problems they've been assigned in the best way they see fit.
  9. Product mindset, a product-mind set organisation, the product teams exist to serve the company's customers in ways that meet the needs of the business.
  10. Time to innovate, at scale its very possible that your product teams are entirely consumed just doing what we call keep the lights on activities. Fixing bugs, implementing capabilities for different parts of the business, addressing technical debt, and more.
