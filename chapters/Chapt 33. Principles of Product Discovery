## Principles of Product Discovery

- Product Discovery Purpose:
  1. Value Risk: will the customer buy this, or choose to use it?
  2. Usability Risk: can the user figure out how to use it?
  3. Feasibility Risk: can we build it?
  4. Business Viability Risk: does this solution work for our business?
- Product discovery needs evidence to back ideas, opinions or narratives.
- Core principles for product discovery:
  1. *Customers don't know what is possible, and with technology products, none of us know what we really want until we actually see it*.
  2. The most important thing is to establish compelling value. You need to create the necessary value so the customer ultimately chooses to buy or use it.
  3. Good user experience is essential for the success of the product.
  4. Functionality, design, and technology are inherently intertwined. Very important that the product manager, product designer and team lead are working together all the time to solve the problems.
  5. Marc Andreessen "The most important thing is to know what you can't know".
  6. Results of discovery must be validated on real users and customers before discovery can turn into something more.
  7. Our goal in discovery is to validate our ideas the fastest, cheapest way possible.
  8. We need to validate the feasibility of our ideas during discovery, not after.
  9. We need to validate the business viability of our ideas during discovery, not after.
  10. Its about shared learning.
  11. Ethical, should we build it. Killer robots may seem like you're saving soldiers lives (at least on our side).
- Competent teams trained in modern discovery techniques can generally test on the order of 10-20 iterations per week.
