## Chapter 46 Feasibility Prototype Technique

* Feasibility risks/concerns include:
  1. Algorithm concerns.
  2. Performance concerns.
  3. Scalability concerns.
  4. Fault tolerance concerns.
  5. Use of technology the team has not used before.
  6. Use of a third-party component or service the team has not used before.
  7. Use of a legacy system the team has not used before.
  8. Dependency on new or related changes by other teams.
  
 * The feasibility prototype is enough code to answer/mitigate the feasibility risk but far short of productionable code.
