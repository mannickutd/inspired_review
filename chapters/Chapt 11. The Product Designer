## Chapter 11 The Product Designer

* "Modern product designers continuously collaborate with product managers and engineers from discovery and delivery."
* "Rather than being measured on the output of their design work, the product designer is measured on the success of the product."
* UX is critical importance to the success of the product. UX includes all touch points with the product (offline and online).
* "Good product designers think about the customer's journey over time as they interact with the product and with the company as a whole."
* "Good product designers use prototypes as their primary canvas for communicating ideas, both internally and externally."
* "Good product designers are constantly testing their ideas with real users and customers."
* "If you're building user-facing products, it's critically important that you get a trained product desginer for your team."
* "We need design - not just as a service to make our product beautiful - but to discover the right product."
* "In strong teams, the design informs the functionality at least as much as the functionality drives the design."
* How the product manager should work with the product designer:
  1. Do whatever you need to do to have your designer sit next to you.
  2. Include your designer from the very inception of every idea.
  3. Include your desinger in as many customer and user interactions as possible. Learn about the users and customers together.
  4. Fight your temptation to provide your designer with your own design ideas. Give your designer as much room as possible to solve the design challenges him or herself.
  5. Encourage your designer to iterate early and often. The best way you can encourage this is to not get all nitpicky about design details with the very early iterations. More generally, encourage your designer to feel free not to just iterate on the particular design approach but to explore alternative solutions to the problem.
