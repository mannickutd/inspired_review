## Chapter 16 The Role of Leadership

- One of the big challenges of growth is knowing how the whole product bangs together. Some people like to think holistic view as connecting the dots between the teams.
- To ensure a holistic view of how the entire system fits together from a business point of view (product vision, strategy, functionality, business rules and business logic), we need either the leaders of the product management organization (VP product, directors of product) or a principal product manager.
- One of the most important roles in a company is the person or people responsible for the holistic user experience. These leaders must ensure a consistent and effective user experience systemwide.
- The CTO, managers, and architects are responsible for the holistic view of the system implementation. They should be reviewing the architecture and systems design of all the software.
