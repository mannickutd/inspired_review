## Chapter 1 Behind Every Great Product

* "It is my strong belief, and the central concept driving this book, that behind every great product there is someone - usually someone behind the scenes, working tirelessly - who led the product team to combine technology and design to solve real customer problems in a way that met the needs of the business"

* A product team is consists of a product manager and 2 - 10 engineers.
