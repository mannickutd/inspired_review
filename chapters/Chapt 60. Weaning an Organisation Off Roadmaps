## Chapter 60 Weaning an Organisation Off Roadmaps

* How to move away from old style product roadmaps:
  1. Plan to continue with your existing roadmap process for six to 12 months.
  2. Starting immediately, every time you reference a product roadmap item, or discuss it in a presentation or meeting, be sure to include a reminder of the actual business outcome that feature is intended to help.
* "The goal is that over time, the organisation moves its focus from specific features launching on specific dates to business results."
* Why are stakeholders attracted to roadmaps:
  1. Visibility into what resources are working on.
  2. Coordinate teams to work on prority work.
* "The modern alternative to roadmaps discussed here addresses both of these concerns. Teams work on the prioritised business objectives determined by the leaders; we share our key results transparently; and we commit to high-integrity commitments when critical delivery dates are needed."
