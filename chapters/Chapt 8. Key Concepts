## Chapter 8 Key Concepts

* Holistic Product:
  "This certainly includes the *functionality* - the features. But it also includes the *technology* that enables this functionality. It also includes the *user experience design* that presents this functionality. And it includes how we *monetize* this functionality. It includes how we attract and *acquire users and customers*. And it can also include *offline experiences* as well that are essential to delivering the product's value."
* Continuous Discovery and Delivery
  1. We need to discover the product to be built, and
  2. We need to deliver that product to market.
  These 2 activities are ongoing and in parallel.
* Product Discovery - Discovery is the intense collaboration of product management, user experience design, and engineering. The output of product discovery is a validated product backlog. Answer 4 questions:
  1. Will the user buy this?
  2. Can the user figure out how to use it?
  3. Can our engineers build this?
  4. Can our stakeholders support this?
* Prototypes - Prototypes are used to aid in answering the product discovery questions above. The idea of prototypes is to provide answers to questions from the product team which do not require the team creating a fully featured product. *Strong teams normally test many product ideas each week - on the order of 10 to 20 or more per week*.
* Product Delivery - "The purpose of product delivery is to build and deliver these production-quality technology products, something you can sell and run a business on.
* Products and Product/Market Fit - *smallest possible actual product that meets the needs of a specific market of customers*.
* Product Vision - Longer term objective of this product (2-10 years into the future).
* "MVP should be a prototype, not a product".
