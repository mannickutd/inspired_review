## Chapter 29 Product Team Objectives

- OKR - Objectives and key results
- If you deploy OKR's for you product organisation, thee key is to focus the OKRs at the product team level.
- If different functional organizations (such as design, engineering or QA) have larger objectives (such as responsive design, technical debt, and test automation) they should be discussed and prioritized at the leadership team level along with the other business objectives, and then incorporated into the relevant product team objectives.
- The key is that the cascading of OKRs in a product organization needs to be up from the cross-functional product teams to the company or business-unit level.
