## Chapter 55 Testing Feasibility

* Do we know how to build this?
* Do we have the skills on the team to build this?
* Do we have enough time to build this?
* Do we need any architectual changes to build this?
* Do we have on hand all the components we need to build this?
* Do we understand the dependencies involved in building this?
* Will the performance be acceptable?
* Will it scale to the levels we need?
* Do we have the infrastructure necessary to test and run this?
* Can we afford the cost to provision this?
* Many of our best product ideas are based on approaches to solving the problem that are only now possible, which means new technology and time to investigate and learn that technology.
* With hardware, the consequences of a mistake in terms of time and money are much more severe.
