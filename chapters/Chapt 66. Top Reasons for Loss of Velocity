## Chapter 66 Top Reasons for Loss of Velocity

* The following reasons are for a product teams loss of velocity:
  1. Technical debt, the architect no longer facilitates or enables the rapid evolution of the product.
  2. Lack of strong product managers, the lack of strong and capable product managers is typically a major reason for slow product.
  3. Lack of delivery management, the most important function of the delivery manager is to remove impediments, and the list of impediments grows non-linearly as the technology organisation grows.
  4. Infrequent release cycles, most teams with slow velocity have release vehicles that are too infrequent (strive for multiple times per day).
  5. Lack of product vision and strategy, its essential the teams has a clear vision of the big picture and how their immediate work contributes to the whole.
  6. Lack of co-located, durable product teams. If teams are split across locations or worse if engineers are outsourced. Typically if teams (or parts) are outsourced, another layer of people will be added to coordinate and communicate which usually makes communication worse.
  7. Not including engineers early enough during product discovery, the engineers need to participate in product discovery from the start of ideation.
  8. Not utilising product design in discovery and instead having them try to do their work at the same time the engineers are trying to build.
  9. Changing priorities, realise that rapidly shifting priorities cause significant churn and substantially reduces the total throughput and morale.
  10. A consensus culture, "you cannot please everyone at once", although good intentioned it ultimately slows down the velocity.
