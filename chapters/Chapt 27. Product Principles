## Chapter 27 Product Principles

- An example principle from eBay, they found they needed a product principle that spoke to the relationship between buyers and sellers. Most of the revenue came from sellers, so we had a strong incentive to find ways to please sellers, but we soon realized that the real reason sellers loved us was because we provided them with buyers. This realization let to a critical principle that stated, "In cases where the needs of the buyers and the sellers conflict, we will prioritize the needs of the buyer, because thats actually the most important thing we can do for sellers."
