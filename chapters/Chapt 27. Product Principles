## Chapter 27 Product Principles

- Product principles speak to the nature of the products you want to create. Product principles are not a list of features, and they are not tied to any one product release. The principles are aligned with the product vision for an entire product line.
- An example principle from eBay, they found they needed a product principle that spoke to the relationship between buyers and sellers. Most of the revenue came from sellers, so we had a strong incentive to find ways to please sellers, but we soon realized that the real reason sellers loved us was because we provided them with buyers. This realization let to a critical principle that stated, "In cases where the needs of the buyers and the sellers conflict, we will prioritize the needs of the buyer, because thats actually the most important thing we can do for sellers."

- Product objectives from 2 fundamental principles.
  1. The first can easily be summed up with the famous General George Patton quote - "Never tell people how to do things. Tell them what to do and they will surprise you with their ingenuity."
  2. The second was captured by HP's tagline of that era: "The idea here is that you can release all the features you want, but if it doesn't solve the underlying business problem, you haven't really solved anything."
 - The first principle is fundamentally about how to empower and motivate people to get them to do their best work, and the second is about how to meaningfully measure progress.
