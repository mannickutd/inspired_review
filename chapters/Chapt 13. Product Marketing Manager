## Chapter 13 Product Marketing Managers
* Product marketing managers are not usually a full time member of the team.
* "Product marketing plays an essential role in discovery, delivery, and, ultimately, go-to-market, which is why they are important members of the product team.
* "Modern product marketing managers represent the market to the product team -  the positioning, the messaging, and a winning go-to-market plan. They are deeply engaged with the sales channel and know their capabilities, limitations and current competitive issues.
* It is very important that you as a product manager understand the market and the corresponding product marketing manager understands the product.
