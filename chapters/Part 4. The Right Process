## Part 4 The Right Process

- "The Right Process"; is not a single process but rather more accurately described as a combination of techniques, mindset, and culture.
- The bulk of the product managers time needs to be focused on working with her product team, with her key stakeholders, and with her customers to discover solutions that her customers love and that work for the business.
- Product discovery:
  1. The demand, this includes everything from making sure there are enough customers that even need this solution and then coming up with a solution that works for our customers and for our business.
  2. The product, we need to make sure that we come up with a single solution that works for many customers, not a series of specials.
- Strong teams meet the dual and simulataneous objectives of rapid learning in discovery, yet building stable and solid releases in delivery.
- The term 'product' is reserved to describe the state at which we can run a business on it.
- The purpose of product discovery is to make sure we have some evidence that when we ask teh engineers to build a production-quality product it won't be a wasted effort.
- The key to discovering great products is getting your ideas in front of real users and customers early and often.
- The key to delivering great products, is to use best practices for engineering and trying not to override the engineer's concerns.
