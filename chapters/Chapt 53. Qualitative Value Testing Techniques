## Qualitative Value Testing Techniques

* Qualitative value testing can let us know whats happening (or not happening) but it can't explain why.
* "I argue that qualitative testing of your product ideas with real users and customers is probably the single most important discovery activity for you and your product team."
* Usability test, create a test to test whether the user can figure out how to operate our product. Value test should be conducted after the usability test.
* Usability and value tests require that the user use a prototype that has been created by the product team.
* Using money to demonstrate value, is the user will to pay for it. We want to see the user willing to pull out their credit card to pay for it while using the test.
* Using reputation to demonstrate value, is the user willing to recommend the product to their friends or colleagues?
* Using time to demonstrate value, are users will to devote a significant amount of time to work with you on it?
* Using access to demonstrate value, are using willing to create an account to use your product?
* Very significant that product managers attend/overview every single value test. Product designers and engineers are also important attendees.
