## Chapter 28 The OKR Technique

- Objectives and Key Results (OKR), is a tool for management, focus and alignment.
- Key principles for OKR
  1. Objectives should be qualitative, key results need to be quantitative/measureable.
  2. Key results should be a measure of business results, not output or tasks.
  3. The rest of the company will use OKR's a bit differently, but for the product management, design, and technology organization, focus on the organization's objectives and the objectives for each product team, which are designed to roll up and achieve the organization objectives.
  4. Find a good cadence for your organization.
  5. Keep the number of objectives and key results for the organization and for each team small (one to three objectives, with one to three key results each is typical).
  6. Its critical that every product team track their active progress against those objectives (which is typicall weekly).
  7. The objectives do not need to cover every little thing the team does, but they should cover what the team needs to accomplish.
  8. Its important that, one way or another, teams feel accountable to achieving their objectives. If they fail substantially, its worth having a post-mortem/retrospective with some of their peers or management.
  9. Agree as an organization on how you will be evaluating or scoring your key results (consistency across the business).
  10. Establish very clear and consistent ways to indicate when a key result is in reality a high-integrity commitment rather than a normal objective.
  11. Be very transparent on what objectives each product team is working on and their current progress.
  12. Senior management is responsible for the organization objectives and key results. The heads of product and technology are responsible for the product teams objectives. The individual product teams are responsible for proposing the key results for each objective they've been assigned.
